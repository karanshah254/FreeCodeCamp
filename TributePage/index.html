                <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression
                    era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
                    helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                </li>
                <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
                    modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
                    crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for
                    a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
